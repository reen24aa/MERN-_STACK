This is a responsive and user-friendly to-do list website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage tasks with features like adding, editing, and deleting, and includes Firebase-powered authentication for secure sign-up and sign-in. Tasks are organized into completed and uncompleted sections, and a celebration message appears when all tasks are done. The site offers a straightforward and efficient task management experience.
